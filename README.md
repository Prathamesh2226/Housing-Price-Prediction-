# Housing-Price-Prediction-
Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Simple Linear Regression to predict house prices based on the square footage of the property. By analyzing the relationship between square footage and house price, the model provides a foundational understanding of how housing characteristics influence prices.

Objectives

Predict House Prices: Develop a regression model to estimate house prices using square footage as the primary feature.
Understand Relationships: Analyze the linear relationship between square footage and house prices.
Provide Insights: Offer insights to buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions.
Methodology

Data Collection:

The dataset contains two columns:
Square Footage: Size of the house in square feet.
Price: Actual price of the house.

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Handle missing or erroneous values.
Normalization: Standardize features to improve model performance.

Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess model performance.

Tools & Libraries

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
Pandas and NumPy: Data handling and preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Building and evaluating the regression model.

Results
A clear positive correlation between square footage and house prices.
The model achieves X% accuracy in predicting house prices based on square footage.

Future Improvements
Include additional features like location, number of bedrooms, and lot size for better predictions.
Use advanced regression techniques like Polynomial Regression or Multiple Linear Regression.
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
